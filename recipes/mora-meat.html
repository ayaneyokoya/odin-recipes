    <img src = "../images/mora-meat.jpeg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A large hunk of minced meat packaged inside of a pastry. When you split the pastry in two, minced meat spills out. The taste of meat grease is all but gone, and the baking process has brought out the sweetness of the pastry. Such pastries are usually stamped with the word "Mora," all the better to represent wealth and fortune.</p>
