    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A dessert made out of almond. It has a silky-smooth texture with a long-lasting aroma of almond. It's named tofu only because of its tofu-like shape. This version is Xiao's specialty. His dream is very simple, and it is merely a lovely dream.</p>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <h4>Almond Tofu</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour your milk into a bowl and add the almond powder little by little, mixing well.</li>
        <li>Pour water, agar, and sugar into a pot on low heat and stir until fully dissolved.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, and then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the milk and almond powder mixture into the pot and then reheat over low heat.</li>
        <li>Once everything is fully combined, pour the mixture into a heatproof container and carefully remove any foam from the top.</li>
        <li>Set aside.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Matcha Jelly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>The matcha jelly will follow the same steps as the Almond Tofu.</li>
        <li>Pour water, agar, and sugar into a pot on low heat and stir until fully dissolved.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, and then turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the matcha powder into the pot and then reheat over low heat.</li>
        <li>Once everything is fully combined, pour the mixture into a heatproof container using a strain and carefully remove any foam from the top.</li>
        <li>Now put both the almond tofu and matcha jelly into the fridge and let it chill for about an hour.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Osmanthus Syrup</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Place your flowers into a colander and shake off the stems.</li>
        <li>Pour water and sugar into a pot on low heat and cook until the sugar is fully dissolved.</li>
        <li>Next, add your honey and salt into the mixture and mix well.</li>
        <li>Once everything has fully dissolved, turn off the heat and add the osmanthus flowers. Stir slowly for about two minutes and pour into a sterilized jar.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Assembly</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Now that all of the items are prepared, begin cutting the almond tofu into medium-size cubes, and the matcha jelly into tiny cubes.</li>
        <li>Place tofu on the plate, and stack one on top. Place the smaller matcha cubes on top of the almond tofu.</li>
        <li>Pour the osmanthus syrup over the tofu, and it is complete!</li>
        <li>Optional: Add white, pink, and green small mochi balls around the almond tofu and enjoy.</li>
